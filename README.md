# assets-tracker-api

assets-tracker-api is Asset Tracker REST API built using Go/Gin and Postgres.

## Data Simulation 

To simulate nodes movement we approximate it's position relative original value adjusted by a unique two directional offset based on timestamp.

To address performance issues generating a rich GEOJSON response with calculating of 10k+ nodes langlot, a dynamic Postgres JSON function was used with struct Scan on autogenerated fields.

## Installation

```bash
pnpm i

```

## Configuration

The following ENV variables have to be configured:

DSN - Postgres DSN

GIN_PORT - API public port
